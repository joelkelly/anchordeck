# AnchorDeck 0.0.1 (Alpha)

A simple way for clients to be granted control of masthead creation. The idea is to allow them to change things like price points and tag lines.  Assets can be managed by the designers and exposed to the client for manipulation. This allows for a high level of quality control with a drastic reduction of repetitive production for the designer/developer.
